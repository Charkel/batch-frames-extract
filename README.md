# Bulk Video Frames Extractor in Python #

This is a simple script that extract all frames from all videos in the input folder.
Then outputs the frames as .png files into the output folder.

I made this for use with DeepFaceLab, to quickly create a single folder of training images from a bunch of videos in one go.

## How to use ##

Make sure you have python installed.

In terminal, run the following command:

``python python.py''
