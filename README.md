# Bulk Video Frames Extractor in Python #

This is a simple script that extract all frames from all videos in the input folder.
Then outputs the frames as .png files into the output folder.

I made this for use with DeepFaceLab, to quickly create a single folder of training images from a bunch of videos in one go.

## How to use ##

Make sure you have python installed.

In terminal, run the following command:

```
python python.py
```

Or:

```
python3 python.py
```

It will check for opencv-python and attempt to install it. You can install it manually by using:

```
pip install opencv-python
```

Or:

```
pip3 install opencv-python
```

## Notes ##

Please be aware that this script was created by GPT-4, with minimal edits from myself, but I can verify that it works for my purposes.
